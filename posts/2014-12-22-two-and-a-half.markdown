After the weekend, there are just two and a half days left of work before I fly back to England with Kasumi.

Tomorrow (Tuesday 23<sup>rd</sup>) is a holiday, so it doesn't count.

So over the weekend, I went to volunteer at a Christmas party for kids, and played futsal last night. Scored a few good goals, made a few nice passes, set up a couple of nice ones. Overall, a fairly satisfying experience.
