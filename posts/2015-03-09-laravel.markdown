Got back from Kansai last night, managed to get on the wrong shinkansen, get off at Nagoya and catch up to the one I meant to ride.

Kansai was great, nice to see Kasumi's parents and enjoy some good food.
Night bus was shit though.

It's ten days under the Kurashicom interview. Still need to prepare a few things.

  - need to buy something from the shop
  - need to set up my website for my fake town, 森盛市
  - need to study the fuck out of laravel and angularjs

Also need to prepare for Kasumi's birthday on Friday, and Dad's birthday on Saturday.
