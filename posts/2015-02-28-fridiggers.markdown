January: done. Moving on to February: done.

I applied for the Kurashicom position and got an interview on 19th March.
I also had an interview on Tuesday 24th Feb for the back-end engineer position at Poole/LIG Inc., but I don't think I'll get it since I have no experience.

This week, I mostly worked on configuring Laravel and Rails apps, and also working on JB3.11 pages for the Four Years On content.

Almost the weekend, so can chill a bit.
