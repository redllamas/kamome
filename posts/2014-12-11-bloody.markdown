It's been a few days, but here's another update to test hakyll.

I still haven't really edited the Haskell files much, but I've been studying a bit more with ["Learn Haskell Hard and Fast"](http://yannesposito.com/Scratch/en/blog/Haskell-the-Hard-Way/), which is proving to be a more direct, terser version of LYAHFGG.

Just to test

```haskell
    f :: Num a => a -> a
```
