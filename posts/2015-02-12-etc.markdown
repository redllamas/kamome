January has gone by in a flash, and oh shit, I need to submit my application for the Kurashicom job.
I've written the essay, just hope it's not complete bollocks.

Since then, I've finished learnyounode, stream-adventure, and I've been trying to complete the Ruby Koans series too.

I have to complete the application for Kurashicom tonight, and send it off by tomorrow. I hope I can get it done.

To do:
  - back to Yokohama to check for bills & 確定申告 paperwork
  - back home for dinner and to work on the application
  - try to sort out receipts monthly and also by category, then calculate the numbers
