Eleven days ago I guess I wrote this entry, worried about the Kurashicom interview.

Eleven days later, I've had the interview, and now I have a slightly better idea of what I need to do.

Going to try and improve or add a feature to [snakkes](https://github.com/oliverlundquist/snakkes) by [Oliver Lundquist](https://github.com/oliverlundquist/).

Was thinking of some ideas:

  - change colour before playing
  - change object in middle
  - bonus level
  - computer ai
  - cheats?
  - temporary power ups (speed/width/agility)
  - opposite effect on opponents

### moving on swiftly

Today is also twenty years since the Aum sarin gas attacks on the subway.

Saw a documentary about them the other day and it was fucking scary.
